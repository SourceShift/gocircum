# Dependency Security Management

## SOCKS5 Library Maintenance Plan

This document outlines the maintenance plan for our fork of the SOCKS5 library (`github.com/gocircum/go-socks5-maintained`), addressing the security concerns with the original unmaintained library (`github.com/armon/go-socks5`).

### Background

The original `github.com/armon/go-socks5` library has not been maintained since 2016, presenting a significant security risk for our application. As a security-focused project designed to withstand sophisticated adversaries, we must ensure all dependencies are actively maintained and secure.

### Maintenance Strategy

1. **Forked Repository**
   - We have forked the original codebase to `github.com/gocircum/go-socks5-maintained`.
   - This repository is under our organization's control, allowing us to apply security updates and fixes.

2. **Initial Security Audit**
   - A comprehensive security audit of the codebase will be conducted to identify:
     - Resource exhaustion vulnerabilities
     - Protocol-level bugs
     - Edge case handling issues
     - Memory safety concerns
     - Input validation issues
     - Potential denial-of-service vectors

3. **Regular Maintenance Schedule**
   - **Quarterly Security Reviews**: The codebase will undergo a security review every three months.
   - **Dependency Scans**: Automated vulnerability scanners will run weekly to detect potential issues.
   - **Protocol Compliance**: Updates to SOCKS5 RFC compliance will be applied as needed.

4. **Security Hardening Improvements**
   - Enhanced input validation for SOCKS5 protocol messages
   - Resource limiting and timeout mechanisms to prevent DoS attacks
   - Improved error handling and logging
   - Memory usage optimizations

5. **Testing Strategy**
   - Comprehensive test suite covering the SOCKS5 protocol edge cases
   - Fuzz testing for protocol parsing components
   - Load testing to identify resource exhaustion points
   - Integration testing with the main application

6. **Release Process**
   - Semantic versioning for all releases
   - Detailed changelogs documenting security improvements
   - Security advisories for any identified vulnerabilities

### Long-term Plan

While this fork serves as an immediate mitigation for the security risk, we will evaluate alternative options:

1. **Replacement Library**: Research modern, actively maintained SOCKS5 libraries that could serve as a complete replacement.
2. **In-house Implementation**: Consider developing a lightweight, security-focused SOCKS5 implementation specifically designed for our needs.
3. **Community Maintenance**: Explore collaborating with other security-focused projects to jointly maintain a hardened SOCKS5 library.

### Migration Path

The current implementation uses the following approach to enable a smooth transition:

1. **Import Path Change**: All imports in the codebase now reference `github.com/gocircum/go-socks5-maintained`.
2. **Temporary Replacement**: A `replace` directive in `go.mod` temporarily points to the original library until our fork is established.
3. **Progressive Migration**: As we implement security improvements in our fork, we will update the `replace` directive to point to specific versions of our maintained fork.

### Audit Trail

All security audits, fixes, and improvements will be documented in the repository's `SECURITY.md` file, providing a transparent record of the security measures implemented.

### Responsibility

The security team is responsible for maintaining this fork and ensuring it remains secure and up-to-date. Regular reports on the status of this dependency will be included in the project's security reviews.
